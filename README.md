# Appointment Booking System:
  -  This is a simple appointment booking system developed using Flask, MySQL, HTML and CSS.
  -  It allows clients to book appintments with doctors and view their booked appointments

## Project Context: 
  This project was developed as a part of my Process Testing (PCT316D) module for my Diploma in Informatics at the Tshwane University of Technologyl. 
  the goal is to show the various phases of the SDLC, including requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing and deployment.

### SDLC phases covered: 
  1. Requirements gathering - Conducted an interview and did an observation of a doctors office to gather requirements
  2. Design - Created UML diagramsto visualize the database schema and user interactions
  3. Implementation - Developed the application by following the design specifications
  4. Testing - (Still to be done) Going to conduct unit tests using pytest to ensure the functionality of the application
  5. Deployment - Deployed on a local server for demonstration puposes and to test in real time 

## Features: 
 - User authentication: Users can login using their username and password. (so far I only use admin as its hardcoded)
 - Appointment booking: Users can book appointments by and choose the doctors they would be looking to see on that day. (Plan on adding the times as well)
 - Appointment viewing: After the login, the system automatically lands on the booked appointments where users can see the offices booked appointments for the day.
 - Responsive: Application is designed to work on both mobile devices and deskop devices.
